# CS475FinalProject
## TODO BY PRIORITY
1. create PREPARE statements for commands we want to run.
2. create a file that adds a bunch of data into the database for testing our scripts on.
3. write python scripts that execute PREPARE statements. NOTE: we will need a lot of these so we can divide up the work here, and no single person will do this whole step by themselves.
5. create a server that listens for CRUD commands, queries, ext.
6. create a client that tells server to do CRUD commands, queries, ext.
